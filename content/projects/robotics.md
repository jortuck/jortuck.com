## About

In January 2025, I approached the Husky Robotics team at the University of Washington (my current school) with an offer to
redesign and rebuild their website.

The previous website, built with Square Space, was slow, clunky, and lacked the modern feel and look needed to convey the mission of Husky Robotics.

I collaborated with the club’s operations lead to turn a NASA-inspired Figma mockup into a fully responsive and animated website using Nuxt, Vue, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP. 
The new site, hosted on Cloudflare pages, is fully responsive, performs significantly faster than the previous site, contains more up-to-date content, and provides a fully 
functional contact form.

As of 2025, I’m still serving as the webmaster for Husky Robotics.
